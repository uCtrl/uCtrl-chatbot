# Hubot

This is a version of GitHub's Campfire bot, hubot. He's pretty cool.

This bot is currently deployed on [Heroku][heroku] using a free instance. We're using HipChat as our chat system, so Hubot is using the [HipChat Adapter][hipchat adapter]

## Scripts

Here's a [list][hubot-scripts] of all the scripts we can use.
To add a script to Hubot, simply edit `./hubot-scripts.json` file.

## Custom scripts

In the folder `./scripts` you can find some examples of custom scripts. 
Here's a list of ideas we have:

*   DreamCheeky bot to shoot people in the room
*   wrench me to reply Wrencheries
*   milliard me
   *   Calvaire, Albert
   *   Calisse, Antoine
   *   Fuck off, Martin
   *   Ah non, Josianne
